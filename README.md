# Shopper-Spectrum-Customer-Segmentation-and-Product-Recommendations-in-E-Commerce
Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation system using RFM analysis, K-Means clustering, and item-based collaborative filtering. Includes end-to-end data preprocessing, EDA, model evaluation, and an interactive Streamlit app for real-time insights.

📌 Problem Statement

Retail businesses often:

Treat all customers the same

Lack data-driven segmentation

Waste marketing budget on low-value customers

Without structured behavioral modeling, personalization becomes guesswork.
🚀 Solution Overview

Shopper Spectrum builds intelligent customer profiles through:

1️⃣ Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)

Model: K-Means Clustering

Customers are grouped based on:

Spending behavior

Purchase frequency

Recency

Basket size

Output:

High-value customers

Budget buyers

Infrequent shoppers

Seasonal spenders

2️⃣ Purchase Prediction (Supervised Learning)

Model: Random Forest / Logistic Regression

Predicts:

Likelihood of high spending

Probability of churn

Future purchase behavior

3️⃣ Revenue Forecasting

Model: Random Forest Regressor

Predicts:

Expected customer lifetime value

Future spending potential

🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline
Data Preprocessing

Missing value handling

Outlier treatment

Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

Encoding categorical variables

Feature Engineering

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics

Average basket size

Transaction frequency

Model Evaluation

Clustering:

Silhouette Score

Inertia

Classification:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Regression:

R² Score
